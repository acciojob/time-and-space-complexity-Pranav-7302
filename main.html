    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a way of analyzing and describing the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete its task
        relative to the size of the input data. It helps to assess the efficiency or efficient of an algorithm,
        especially when dealing with large inputs.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> O(n)
        Space complexity refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to execute, including both
        auxiliary space (extra space or temporary space used during computation) and the space required for input. It is
        an important aspect of algorithm analysis, as it helps us understand how much memory an algorithm uses as the
        input size grows.</p>
